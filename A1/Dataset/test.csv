"Yeah, I get that argument. At this point, I'd prefer is she lived in NC as well."
The blazers and Mavericks (The wests 5 and 6 seed) did not even carry a good enough record to make the playoffs in the east last year.
They're favored to win.

What's your weird or unsettling Trick or Treat story?

Probably Sephiroth. I refuse to taint his greatness with *my* weak builds. He should equip *ONLY* the best TMs.
"What to upgrade? I have $500 to spend (mainly because it's my birthday on the 31st) and I'm not really sure what to upgrade. I don't have to spend all $500, I could spend as little or all of it if I want. Specs are: CPU: i5-6600K Cooler: CM 212 EVO RAM: 8GB Corsair Vengence LPX 2400MHz GPU: EVGA GTX 1070 SC Case: Corsair Spec Alpha PSU: EVGA P2 650w Storage: One 480 GB Corsair Force LE Monitor: BenQ XL2411Z Keyboard: Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition What I'm thinking of right now is: -Get a 1TB WD Blue -Buy another 8GB of RAM -Replace my Razer Blackwidow with a keyboard with actual Cherry MX switches -Replace my case (Doesn't really offer features for good cable management) -Save up for a Volta Card"
"Probably count Kanye out Since the rest of his tour is canceled, it doesn't seem in the cards. But he's also so unpredictable, it could change. Thankfully I saw him before he started canceling shows, going on long rants and showing up late. But I'd love to see him again, especially at Lolla. Thoughts?"
"I bet if that money was poured into college debt or health debt relief, 81% of Americans would have been for it instead."

There's no time to worry about leaks when they gays are already out to get you.
Team Specific Threads No matter how many articles you read or how many hours of Red Zone you watch nothing quite makes up for watching every play of a game. Would the members of this community/the mods be open to creating a sticky post that has a team individual thread for every team in the NFL where team specific conversation can take place and people that watch individual games can comment? We may even be able to get some guys from team specific subreddits to stop by and give us some new insight.
Ill give you a hint. They commented in this thread
"Star Wars, easy. I'm not that bothered about Indiana Jones tbh"
You're adorable.
"He actually acts like a moody emo girl on twitter. He lashes out over incredibly petty things and takes it out on social media. He's a 70 year old man doing this, grow the fuck up and think of your dignity man."
"Clinton struggles to gain traction in Florida, despite spending - Clinton shocked money can't buy everything"
Is that the Older Clark and Older Lois?
"*Guilt roles over Mel, and he hesitates for a moment before pulling the girl into a hug.* ""Shhh, it's okay Tara. You two aren't going anywhere this time. Aurelia and I won't let that happen."""
They will never get the stability of the 3DS.
"I still doubt that ""all conservatives stand for is defeating liberals"". If you use the election of Trump as an example for the failure of modern conservatism, is it also fair to use the election of Hillary Clinton as a representative for modern Liberalism? I guess not. And the ""all conservatives stand for is defeating liberals"" could be applied vice versa if you only listen to people who are the loudest."
Today Russian media tweeted out that Wikileaks had released more of Podesta's emails before Wikileaks even did it. There is some control here.
"Thank you, Jagex, for being cool Jagex has always been a cool company, and we could thank them for tons of things, but I just noticed that they don't charge your card as a recurring subscription. So many companies today do scummy things where they try to get you to sign up for something so they can bill you monthly and hope you'll forget about it, but Jagex only runs your subscription for as long as you purchased. I know it's nothing huge, but it's something I appreciate."
467 A lovely way!

"The dumb thing is, they are risking their seller account, too."
PGT: 9/4 vs. Indians All rants and angry posts go here. I'll start. Fuck Fernando Rodney
This is a great response! Too bad about the lack of accolades.
North Korea has never lied. Not once.
"Your house is burning down and you only have time to grab one thing ( not including family or pets ), what do you grab?"
Poor Dan. He looks like he needs some coffee or a energy drink. I don't think I've ever seen him be this quiet during a live stream.
This season's NFC equivalent of the Browns is straight up BUTT FUCKING US. I don't know how to handle this.
"Umm yes! It was a huge scandal, do you not member?"
"Hey... Don't aren't you know that a convoluted unsupported theory which is only ""proven"" by a **Reddit comment** is a definite fact? I mean how can a simple explanation make more sense. Clearly the tinfoil hat explanation always make more sense, always."
